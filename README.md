# Tienda---Consola
Console application for clothing store

This was the final project of a C# introduction course, orientated to engineers with previous experience with C. The goal was to make a console application that modeled a clothing store, allowing to add products to a cart, select a payment method, and also offer an administration module. All this, with an OOP approach.
